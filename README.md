# FakeNewsClassifiers
From the Autumn 2019 Semester Project in [IFT6390](https://admission.umontreal.ca/en/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-6390/) (with [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/)) at UdeM.  
This repository has been rewritten and improved by me (Teo Orthlieb) after the project ended, 
to make it more usable and up-to-date.  

## Notes
Datasets must be put in Datasets/ with one folder per dataset, like so
Datasets:
 - LIAR ([paper](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/papers/acl2017.pdf), [download](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip))
 - fake-news-kaggle ([page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data))
 - Fake-News-corpus ([page](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus))

Just unzip them in their folders.
