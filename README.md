# FakeNewsClassifiers
From the Autumn 2019 Semester Project in [IFT6390](https://admission.umontreal.ca/en/cours-et-horaires/cours/ift-6390/) (with [Ioannis Mitliagkas](http://mitliagkas.github.io/)) at UdeM.  
This repository has been rewritten and improved by me (Teo Orthlieb) after the project ended, 
to make it more usable and up-to-date.  

Datasets must be put in Datasets/ with one folder per dataset, like so
```
Datasets:
    > NELA-GT-2018      // dataset (a)
    > LIAR              // dataset (b)
    > fake-news         // dataset (c) 
    > fake-News-corpus  // dataset (d)
```
Just unzip them in their folders.

Collaborators in the semester project:  
 - Alexie Byrns
 - Jonathan Tremblay
